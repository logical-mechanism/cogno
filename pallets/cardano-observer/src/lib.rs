//! # Cardano-observer pallet (cogno-chain) — in-protocol deterministic observation (D4 weight rung)
//!
//! **Sets `talk-stake` weight from a consensus-verified Substrate INHERENT** carrying the
//! deterministically-observed Cardano `talk_vault` state, replacing the trusted off-chain
//! `talk_stake.set_stake` write. Every importing validator independently re-derives the same Cardano
//! read and rejects the block on mismatch, so the locked-ADA weight becomes a consensus-verified
//! OUTPUT rather than a trusted oracle injection. Aura+GRANDPA are unchanged. Full design +
//! determinism contract: `docs/IN-PROTOCOL-OBSERVATION.md`.
//!
//! ## What is inherent data vs on-chain logic (§4.1)
//! The ONLY thing carried as inherent data is the raw observed `(beacon, lovelace)` set as-of a stable
//! reference slot (the node-side `InherentDataProvider` does that IO, byte-identically across nodes
//! via the shared logic mirrored from `services/_shared/observation.mjs`). Everything else is
//! deterministic on-chain logic that lives here: the `beacon → account` lookup
//! ([`Config::BeaconResolver`] = cogno-gate `AccountOf` in the runtime), the MIN_LOCK floor, the
//! `MaxStakeWeight` bound, weight application + capacity priming ([`Config::WeightSink`] = a
//! talk-stake + microblog adapter), and the unlock clamp.
//!
//! ## The two enforcement layers (§6)
//! - [`ProvideInherent::check_inherent`] does the CROSS-NODE read match only: the importer compares the
//!   author's observation against its OWN node's read at the same reference. When the reduced `entries`
//!   differ, the carried `inputs_commitment` (a `blake2_256` of the pre-reduction candidate set — the
//!   partner-chains `selection_inputs_hash` analog) splits the failure: differing commitments ⇒
//!   [`InherentError::Mismatch`] ("saw different Cardano data"); identical commitments ⇒
//!   [`InherentError::ComputeDiverged`] ("same data, different reduction" — a determinism bug). BOTH are
//!   **fatal** → block rejected; the split is diagnostic. The importer's own source being behind is
//!   [`InherentError::CannotVerify`] (**non-fatal** → accept without verifying — never fork on a slow
//!   node). `check_inherent` is NOT run by every node (warp/state sync skip it; it is not re-run in
//!   `execute_block`), so anything that must hold for EVERY node is enforced in the Mandatory
//!   dispatchable below, which DOES run in `execute_block`.
//! - The `observe` dispatchable is `DispatchClass::Mandatory` and `is_inherent`-only (pool-inadmissible,
//!   the §5.2 mutual-exclusion invariant). It enforces, on every node: reference monotonicity, the
//!   stability sanity bound, the `MaxStakeWeight` skip-not-reject, account resolution, weight + capacity
//!   application, and the unlock clamp.
//!
//! ## Honest posture (§2/§11)
//! `check_inherent`'s "every producer re-derives" is load-bearing only with MULTIPLE independent block
//! producers — on a single-operator stack this is **D4-SHAPED, not D4-TRUST** (it buys consensus-pinned
//! auditability, not trust). Cutting `set_stake` over to inherent-only is co-sequenced with ≥3
//! independent producers; until then this pallet runs in shadow — the runtime wiring + node IDP are
//! LIVE, but `EnforceWeight` defaults to `false`, so the inherent only PROJECTS weight (it records
//! `ShadowStake` without writing `talk_stake`'s `AllowedStake`). The cutover is the `set_enforcement` flip.
