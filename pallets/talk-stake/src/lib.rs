//! # Talk-stake pallet (cogno-chain)
//!
//! **The weight source for the regenerating talk-capacity meter** — a CALL-LESS ledger written
//! **only** by the in-protocol `cardano-observer` inherent (the sole weight writer). Stores one
//! `StakeWeight` per account (the summed buried lovelace backing that identity's posting allowance,
//! `ECONOMICS.md` §6.1) plus one `VotingPower` (its bound stake credential's total Cardano stake, the
//! stake-weighted-vote source).
//!
//! ## No extrinsic, no origin — the observer is the ONLY writer
//! In the all-Rust restart there is **no `set_stake` / `set_voting_power` call and no `SetStakeOrigin`**.
//! Weight enters the chain exclusively through the consensus-verified `cardano-observer` Mandatory
//! inherent, which every importing validator re-derives and rejects on mismatch — so the locked-ADA
//! weight is a consensus-verified OUTPUT, never a trusted oracle injection. The observer applies its own
//! `MaxStakeWeight`/`MaxVotingPower` skip-not-reject BEFORE calling the internal writers here, so a bad
//! value is filtered upstream and never reaches this pallet. A fresh chain with no Cardano (`--dev`/
//! `local`) seeds initial weight via [`GenesisConfig`] (genesis ≠ an extrinsic, so "no external setter"
//! holds).
//!
//! ## Invariants that live here (do not break them)
//! - `apply_weight` writes **only** `AllowedStake`, **never** the `Capacity` row (which lives in
//!   `pallet-microblog`). That separation *is* the going-forward-only rule: raising weight lifts the
//!   future `cap`/`rate` immediately, but the bigger bucket still fills over the window — it never
//!   retroactively credits banked capacity (`ECONOMICS.md` §6.1 part 1).
//! - On **full** unlock the observer writes `weight = 0`; weight is read live, so `cap = rate = 0` and the
//!   next capacity read collapses to `min(0, …) = 0`. The `Capacity` row is **never deleted** (that lives
//!   in microblog), so a relock cannot re-mint a fresh bucket (`ECONOMICS.md` §6.1 part 2).
//! - `AllowedStake` is `ValueQuery` → an unbound/unlocked account reads `0` for free.
